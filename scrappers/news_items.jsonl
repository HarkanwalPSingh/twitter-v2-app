Birds and animals undergo silent pain. Hence, I appeal to the citizens that they must use only green crackers.\u201dHe also said that the state government has also permitted the sale of green crackers during this Deepavali. \u201cThe state government has given permission to use green crackers to check air and sound pollution, and fire accidents. Various chemicals used in the crackers lead to many health complications,\u201d added Siddaramaiah.The Karnataka state government in its recent decision has directed officials to restrict the bursting of crackers between 8pm and 10pm only, on the day of the festival. This comes in the backdrop of a tragedy in Attibele recently, wherein as many as 17 people lost their lives when a cracker go-down caught fire.Pollution control board officials in Karnataka came down hard on sellers of non-eco-friendly crackers and constituted a special task force to ensure thesale of only \"green\u201d ones.The department of municipal administration directed authorities, civic agencies and corporations across the state to enforce the two-hour rule for bursting of crackers by prescribing to the guidelines issued by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB), which were in line with the Supreme Court (SC) directive.", "timestamp": 1699817331430}

Despite its completion, no government has officially accepted the report to date. Veerashaiva Mahasabha president and senior Congress MLA Shamanur Shivashankarappa labelled the report as \u2018flawed.\u2019 The former minister targeted his own party and claimed that the report was written in a home. Veerashaiva Mahasabha, the apex body of the Lingayat community, held a meeting in Bengaluru where they demanded a thorough review of the report, citing flaws in the data collection process. According to Shivashankarappa, the survey was inadequately conducted and the report was crafted in a manner that underrepresented their community. \u201cThere are many flaws in the data collected by the committee. The survey was not done at houses belonging to our community. The survey was not done satisfactorily. A fresh survey must be done scientifically with advanced technology. The report was written by sitting in a home. In the report, the population of Veerashaiva Mahasabha was shown less, it will have a severe impact on our community,\u201d the Davanagere South MLA said. Shivashnakarappa clarified that there were no immediate plans to lead a delegation to meet with the chief minister concerning this matter. The opposition to the Karnataka government\u2019s decision to accept the 2015 caste census report has grown with the prominent seers of the Vokkaliga community expressing their displeasure. Nirmalanandanatha Swami, a prominent Vokkaliga spiritual leader who led the meeting of the community leaders last week, had called the report \u201cdeeply flawed and unscientific\u201d. The seer said, \u201cThe current report is incomplete and could lead to injustices within various communities.\u201d He urged the government to reconsider its decision and suggested that a comprehensive recovery of the population census is necessary to rectify the report\u2019s deficiencies. Meanwhile, federations representing Dalits, tribals, and other backward classes (OBC) have demanded that the findings of the caste census be made public. They allege that certain leaders from dominant communities within the government are blocking the report\u2019s release. They argue that sharing the report\u2019s findings would provide clarity on caste-wise population distribution, and educational, social, and economic status, potentially ending disputes over these issues. \u201cWe\u2019re not insisting on implementing the report. But the government must first receive it and lay it in the assembly for a discussion,\u201d Yennegere Venkaramaiah, convener of the Backward Castes Federation, told media. KM Ramachandrappa, a representative of the marginalised communities\u2019 federation, has said leaders from dominant communities from within the government are obstructing the report\u2019s release by . He added that support from marginalized communities played a pivotal role in bringing the Congress government to power. \u201cThe control of power and wealth is currently concentrated within the hands of two dominant communities. This is a significant factor behind their opposition to the report. Once the report is made accessible to the public, it will offer a comprehensive overview of the state\u2019s caste-wise population distribution,\u201d he said. The groundwork for the caste census was laid during Siddaramaiah\u2019s initial term as chief minister when the state undertook an extensive 2015 survey costing 162 crore. The data was collected from 10.6 million households in Karnataka, involving a workforce of 160,000 personnel who visited homes across the state. Despite Siddaramaiah\u2019s announcement to accept the report in June, its contents and the released date have remained undisclosed. Leaked figures from the report in 2018 had stirred discontent among larger communities like Lingayats and Vokkaligas, as it indicated lower population figures than commonly believed. It\u2019s suggested that the government delayed releasing the report after the leaks, potentially influenced by the approaching 2018 assembly elections. The leaked data indicated that Scheduled Castes (SCs) accounted for 19.5% of the state\u2019s total population, followed by Muslims at 16%. Lingayats and Vokkaligas represented 14% and 11% of the population, respectively. Within the Other Backward Classes (OBCs), the Kuruba community alone comprised 7% of Karnataka\u2019s population, contributing to the OBCs\u2019 overall representation of 20% in the state. Collectively, these groups, including SCs, STs, Muslims, and Kurubas, formed a substantial portion of the population at 47.5%. The political implications of these findings could significantly impact the state\u2019s political landscape, according to federations of marginalised sections.    ", "timestamp": 1699817331521}

The incident took place on the outskirts of Karadaga village in Nippani taluk, Karnataka, at around 8 pm, according to Sadalaga Police Sub-Inspector SM Biradar.The farmers, operating under the banner of \u201cSwabhimani Shethkari Sanghatana,\u201d a farmers\u2019 organisation based in southern Maharashtra and led by former Kolhapur MP Raju Shetty, had recently convened a meeting of sugarcane growers from south Maharashtra and north Karnataka in Kolhapur.During the meeting, a unanimous decision was made not to supply sugarcane to sugar mills in south Maharashtra until they announced a minimum rate of 3,500 per tonne of sugarcane.Former MP Raju Shetty said that southern Maharashtra and northern Karnataka collectively contribute more than 60% of the total sugarcane production in their respective states. When the mills refused to meet the pricing demands put forth by the farmers\u2019 associations, they decided to boycott the mills in the southern region.In defiance of the ban, three farmers, namely Amit Ajit Boskar from Hatkanagala in Kolhapur district, Maharashtra, and Arun Tanaji Chauhan and Praveen Arun Chauhan, both from Hengavali in Nippani taluk, Karnataka, were attempting to transport sugarcane in four trolleys using two tractors to Jawahar Saakar Karkhana (Jawahar Sugar Mill) in Huppari, the last village in Maharashtra in Kagal taluk, located on the border with Karnataka.They were intercepted by local farmers at Karadaga village along the Karadaga-Rendal road, where the vehicle tires were deflated before being set ablaze, as eyewitnesses told HT.\u201cUpon discovering that Karnataka farmers were secretly transporting sugarcane to the mills, they monitored their movements and prevented them by resorting to arson,\u201d he told reporters.Shetty clarified that the protesting farmers symbolically set fire only to the tractor engines and not to the sugarcane-loaded trolleys.A prominent figure known for his aggressive stance; former MP Shetty explained that the farmers resorted to torching the sugarcane transport vehicles as a warning to deter others from following suit. He further criticised sugar mills in both Maharashtra and Karnataka for offering subpar rates and failing to pay their bills promptly. \u201cThe political influence in the matter is evident, as most sugar mills are owned by politicians,\u201d Shetti said.Sadalaga Sub-Inspector Biradar mentioned that additional police personnel have been deployed at the state border to prevent a recurrence of such incidents. \u201cThe owners of the torched tractors have lodged a complaint with the Sadalaga police. case under IPC Section 435, which deals with incidents of vehicle burning,\u201d he said.Siddagouda Modagi, the president of the Belagavi Sugarcane Growers\u2019 Association, supported the burning of tractor of the protesting farmers and urged them not to deviate from the decisions made by the farmers\u2019 organization.

In a press note, the minister revealed some of the findings of the Accountant General Audit Team. There was an extra burden of 47.76 crore on the \u2018client departments\u2019 due to procurement of items and goods at higher rates between 2018 and 2023, he said, giving the details.For example, KEONICS spent 24.15 lakh on each of the computer labs set up in the tribal welfare department, whose market value was only 5.09 lakh. KEONICS procured 40 such units which led to a \u2018financial implication\u2019 (loss) of 7.63 crore, he explained. A payment of 76.5 crore was made without conducting a third-party inspection. Further, 71.5 crore was paid without obtaining photo proof and the inspection report. Using a forged third-party inspection report towards the supply of material, payment of 9.98 crore was made. The auditors also found two sets of delivery challans before and after the supply of goods, he said.", "timestamp": 1699817331694}
